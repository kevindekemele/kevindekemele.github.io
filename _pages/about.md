I am a postdoctoral fellow at the department of Electromechanical, systems and metal engineering at Ghent University, Belgium since 2021. The fellowship is funded by the Special Research Fund.
I obtained my PhD from the same university in april 2021.

My main research interest is investigating how nonlinear passive and active control can benefit vibration control,
energy harvesting and stability. By exploiting nonlinear dynamics, energy can be transferred between frequencies
(’internal resonance’), unstable behavior can be counteracted, and vibration and noise energy can be quickly
transferred. I have experience in both investigating nonlinear phenomenology and in designing, building and testing mechanical and piezoelectrical vibration controllers.
