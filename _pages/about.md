I am a postdoctoral fellow at the department of Electromechanical, systems and metal engineering at Ghent University, Belgium since 2021. The fellowship is funded by the Special Research Fund.
I obtained my PhD from the same university in april 2021.

My main research interest is investigating how nonlinear passive and active control can benefit vibration control,
energy harvesting and stability. By exploiting nonlinear dynamics, energy can be transferred between frequencies
(’internal resonance’), unstable behavior can be counteracted, and vibration and noise energy can be quickly
transferred. I have experience in both investigating nonlinear phenomenology and in designing, building and testing mechanical and piezoelectrical vibration controllers.

This website bundles my research output, ranging from papers, code to talks and blogposts.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
