Contribution: An education innovation in control engineering using practical setups and its evaluation based on a three-year student feedback study and examination grades. Background: Based on extensive research, education’s transition toward active learning and more practical experience has been shown to increase learning outcomes. Contrary to virtual and remote labs, a practical session with an individual setup for each student provides the most practical experience. Intended Outcomes: To show a positive effect on learning performance by integrating practical sessions in basic control engineering. Application Design: Presenting low cost setups that can be mass produced and adapt to the course’s growing complexity. These setups are evaluated during a three-year feedback study. Findings: The developed setups increased understanding of theoretical concepts. The new methodology significantly improved students’ average grades. The students’ interest in control theory is triggered. This case study could guide other institutions toward successfully implementing highly individual practical sessions for large groups.
