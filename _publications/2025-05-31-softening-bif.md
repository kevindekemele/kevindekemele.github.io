This study investigates the control of an impulsively excited one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) oscillator with softening stiffness, modelled with an arctangent characteristic. The goal is to control the host systemâ€™s vibrations by transferring the vibrational energy to an active controller. To this end, a Virtual Mechanical System (VMS) control law is implemented. This law is characterised by controller dynamics, which describe the behaviour of a mechanical system coupled to the host system skew-symmetrically in the velocities and having stiffness identical to that of the host system. The hypothesis is that this similarity and unique coupling facilitate energy transfer. By using the Complexification-Averaging (CxA) technique and examining the slow flow dynamics wrt. fixed points, bifurcations and impulsive orbits, the conditions for energy transfer are uncovered, enabling tuning of the controller.
