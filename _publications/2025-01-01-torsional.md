Torsional vibrations are undesirable in rotating machinery, and demands for better performance and material savings
to reduce weight exacerbate this issue by triggering resonance conditions. The Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES) offers a
robust and effective vibration attenuation solution. In this research, a 2 Degree-Of-Freedom torsionally vibrating host
structure is equipped with a NES having piecewise-linear stiffness approximating a cubic nonlinearity. The first-order
Complexification-Averaging (CxA) method is used to analyse the Slow Flow dynamics on the response envelope, and
a NES tuning methodology based on the Slow Invariant Manifold is proposed for 1:1 resonance attenuation for two
resonance frequencies of the host system. The mechanical design of the NES is optimised for minimal stresses and
fatigue while avoiding local resonances of the individual components. Experiments and numerical simulations validate
the CxA method, and indicate the presence of Strongly Modulated Response regime and an Isolated Resonance Curve
in the vicinity of resonance. Significant resonant response attenuation is achieved for both the first mode (> 80%)
and the second mode (> 65%) over a wide range of forcing amplitudes, with possibility of further improvements. In
this regard, design modifications that allow for effective multi-modal attenuation are presented. As such, a complete
toolchain has been developed to obtain an NES design which can be applied to a wide range of torsional vibration
applications.
