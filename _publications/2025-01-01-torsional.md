Torsional vibrations are of vital importance in rotating machinery, with demands of better performance and material savings potentially inducing resonance conditions. A robust and effective vibration attenuation solution is offered by the Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES). In this research, a 2-DOF torsional host structure is attached to an NES having piecewise-linear stiffness. The design of the NES is optimized for minimal stresses in the local members while avoiding local resonances. The coupled NES-host system is analyzed using Complexification-Averaging of the first-order and validated by experimental and numerical means. While existing research is primarily focused on the resonant response, a study of the possible bifurcations is also needed. In this regard, the experimental validation reveals typical nonlinear behavior of quasi-periodic responses and isolated resonance curves, also with a significant attenuation at resonance. As such, a complete toolchain is developed from analytical tuning, material strength optimization and realization, that can be applied to a wide range of torsional vibration applications
