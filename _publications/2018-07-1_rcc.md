In vibrating mechanical systems, the targeted energy transfer mechanism (TET) of nonlinear energy sinks (NES) is employed as an alternative to linear tuned mass dampers (TMD) as passive vibrations absorbers for transient vibrations. The major advantages a NES has over a linear TMD are (1) an increased robustness to detuning and (2) the ability to dissipate multiple frequencies with only a single NES through so-called resonance capture cascading (RCC). The performance, especially the speed, of TET and RCC has rarely been a topic of research. In this research, algebraic performance measures for the speed of both TET and RCC are derived, called the pumping time and the cascading time, respectively. It shows that cascading time can be seen as a sum of single-mode pumping times, by introducing a novel modal decomposition. The strength of both measures is that they do not require numerical simulations, allowing easy optimization of the NES. The influence of different nonlinearities on the TET and RCC performance is investigated. Actual numerical simulations presented in the study validate the merit of both the pumping time and cascading time.
