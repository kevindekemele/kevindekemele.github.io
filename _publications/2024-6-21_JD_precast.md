Accelerated bridge construction is crucial in bridge engineering. In order to
improve the seismic performance of prefabricated columns, this study proposes
using ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) in the plastic hinge areas of
prefabricated columns with bellows grouting connections. In particular, cyclic
loading tests are carried out on four 1/3-scaled columns, including two castin-place columns and two bellows grouting connection columns. The results
show that columns with UHPC in the plastic hinge areas exhibit larger lateral
and ultimate bearing capacity, ductility, cumulative energy dissipation, and
stiffness compared to those with conventional concrete. Additionally, bellows
grouting connection column with UHPC shows superior seismic performance
compared to cast-in-place column with conventional concrete. The proposed
finite element analysis model is in a good agreement with the test results.
Through using finite element analysis, three key parameters influencing the
seismic performance of bellows grouting columns are examined, and the optimal combination of these parameters is identified.
