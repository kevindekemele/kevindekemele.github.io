A novel device is proposed to obtain arbitrary restoring force characteristics and
nonlinear geometric damping. It consists of linear springs and dampers that are
compressed along a track. The obtained nonlinear damping and stiffness law
depend on the trackâ€™s shape. The device is then applied to obtain a nonlinear
energy sink (NES) to damp the vibrations of a host system. Both the case of
transient vibrations, induced by shock loads, and sustained vibrations, induced
by harmonic loads, are studied. For arbitrary stiffness and damping, slow flow
dynamics and slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) are derived by applying harmonic
balancing and multiple timescales techniques. Under transient vibrations, two
performance measures are derived from the SIM, the relative residual energy and
the pumping time, and are found for generic nonlinear spring force and nonlinear geometric damping. For sustained vibrations, a load-dependent frequency
response (FR) is derived from the SIMs. This FR predicts the occurrence of the
efficient strongly modulated responses but also the occurrence of the unfavorable detached responses called isolas, where the NES fails to mitigate and even
amplifies vibrations.
This research investigates the performance of a conventional cubic NES and a
bistable NES (BNES) with nonlinear damping obtained from the proposed device.
Especially the BNES with nonlinear damping shows attractive properties, with a
high degree of robustness over a wide energy range and a low vibration threshold
under transient loading. Under harmonic loads, the nonlinear damping helps
reduce the effect of isolas. A novel tuning methodology is proposed to avoid
isolas for a range of load magnitudes. The new device opens up a whole range of
possibilities regarding energy dissipation through nonlinear damping
