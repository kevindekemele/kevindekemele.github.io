Me and PhD student Harikhrisnan Venupogal presented at the Recent Advances in Structural Dynamics [ RASD 2024 ](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/rasd/index.pages) in Southampton, UK, which was organized from 01//07-03/07.

The presentations were titled "Design of a Piecewise Nonlinear Energy Sink for Torsional Vibration Attenuation" and "A mechanism for nonlinear geometric damping in passive vibration control: concept, realization and experiments"!

The reception was held in the Solent Sky Museum, a museum dedicated to British aeronautics development and the WW2 Blitz.

After the conference I went to London to check out the Millennium bridge, which famously resonated due to pedestrian traffic! Tuned-mass-dampers were installed to dampen the vibrations.
