During (conference) presentations and seminars, I'd like to make use animations to visualize vibrations simulations such as seen below.
I often asked how I made it, and I tell them a combination of MATLAB, Latex (Tikz) and a commandline tool that makes a GIF from pdfs.
As this is a bit overwhelming on the spot for most people, I've decided to write everything down in this blog post, to encourage others to make similar animations.

First, I'm amusing you have an installation of Latex. Then, in order to make a .GIF from the pdfs output by Latex, you'll need to install [ ImageMagick ](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
