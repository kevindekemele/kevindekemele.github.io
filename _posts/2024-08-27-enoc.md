Me and PhDs student Sarah Geykens & Jundong Fu presented at [ ENOC 2024 ](https://enoc24.dryfta.com/) in Delft, The Netherlands, which was organized from 22//07-26/07.

The presentations were titled:
* An electronic nonlinear energy sink to shunt piezoelectric transducers (Me)
* Experimental study on the Damage Reduction Effect of BNES on Concrete Double-column Piers under Seismic Loads (JunDong)
* Inducing internal resonance through a proportional feedback controller in a two-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mechanical system (Sarah)

For the first presentation, I was shortlisted for the Young Investigators Award (see image below).

The conference banquet was held at the Nieuwe Kerk, and I met with again with Jie Yuan, professor at Southampton University.
